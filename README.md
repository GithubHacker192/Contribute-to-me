# Contribute to me
As the name of this repository says, it is meant for everybody to contribute to.
If you don't know how to code, then it would also help me a lot if you helped me to make the README more attractive or just make this easier for others to contribute to.
I don't know what this will end as, it may become a python tool for solving calculus problems to making an escape room in assembly or anything in between.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for more information.
